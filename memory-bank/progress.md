## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. Begin PR #0 implementation
2. Initialize Git repository
3. Create project structure files
4. Validate prerequisites script works

### This Week
1. Complete PR #0 and PR #1
2. Have basic project structure
3. Have docker-compose environment running

### This Sprint
1. Complete PR #0 through PR #3
2. Have full local development environment working
3. Verify <10 minute setup time locally

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

### What's Working Well
- Comprehensive planning phase
- Clear task breakdown
- Well-defined success criteria
- User collaboration on key decisions

### What to Watch
- Setup time performance (must be <10 minutes)
- Docker image sizes (keep them small)
- AWS costs (stay under $50/month)
- Documentation quality (must be beginner-friendly)

### Lessons Learned
- Original PRD had different architecture (GKE) - always verify with user
- "Dora" was ambiguous - clarification revealed Express.js preference
- Secrets Manager was initially included but out of scope per original PRD
- Important to check for consistency across multiple requirement documents
